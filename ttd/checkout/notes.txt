Unit Test Isolation with Dummies, Fakes, Stubs, Spies, and Mocks

What are Test Doubles?
Almost all code depends (i.e. collaborates) with other parts of the system

Those other parts fo the system are not always easy to replicate in the unit test environment or would make tests slow if used directly

Test doubles are objects that are used inunt tests as replacements to the real production system collaborators





Types of Test Doubles:

Dummy - Objects that can be passed around as necessary but do not have any types of test implementation and should never be userd
Fake - These object generally have a simplified functional implementation of a particular interface tha is adequate for tsting but not for production
Stub - These objects provide implementations with canned answers that are suitable for the test
Spies - These objects provide implementations that record the values that were passed in so they can be used by the test
Mocks - These objects are pre-programmed to expect specific calls and parameters and can throw exceptions when necessary
