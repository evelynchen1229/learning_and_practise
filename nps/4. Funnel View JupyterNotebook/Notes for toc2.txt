Question: How to export files into interactive HTML?
You need special notebook extension called TOC2 (table of contents2)..
Installing it (you really need just #3 but it's safer this way):
pip install ipywidgets jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension
pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions jupyter_nbextensions_configurator jupyter nbextensions_configurator enable --user
Generating it:
# open command prompt in the same folder as your script (eg, jump there like:   
cd "C:\Users\simljx\Documents\Python work\GIT - DPI_report_automation"
# generate the embedded HTML file
jupyter nbconvert filename_of_your_analysis.ipynb --template toc2
If you get an error about toc2 template not found or something like that, it's a backward compatibility problem, you can just overwrite this package:
conda install "nbconvert=5.6.1" --no-update-deps
Alternatively, you'll need to change one configuration file -- let me know and I'll help you!
